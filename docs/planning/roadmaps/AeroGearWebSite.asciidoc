AeroGear Web Site Roadmap
=========================
:Author: Corinne Krych

About this document
-------------------

This document extract most of the suggestions from ML threads, split them in small JIRA tickets in an attempt to organize them.

As AeroGear enhanced its features, we need to make sure information is easeliy found by first time users but also, information, tutorial (per platforms) is available to developer to dig in further.


Initial AG 'per features' design was drafted by hbons in this link:http://aerogear-dev.1069024.n5.nabble.com/aerogear-dev-Website-restructure-td5246.html;cid=1389091451229-905[ML thread]. Feedback an further idea were talked upon on this link:http://aerogear-dev.1069024.n5.nabble.com/aerogear-dev-Fwd-Website-restructure-td5837.html[ML thread]. AergoGear web site revamp will require some drastic changes in documentation structure. Some pages will need refactoring in order to present the information 'per features'.
